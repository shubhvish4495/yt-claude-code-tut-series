Run this application on local using steps defined in README.md. If Docker is installed give preference for database in it only. DO NOT RUN SERVER IN DOCKER. It would be run in separate long running background job in claude bash.


DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES IN ANY FILES AS THIS IS JUST A COMMAND TO RUN. AT MAX YOU CAN SUGGEST CHANGES BUT SHOULD NOT MAKE THEM.
